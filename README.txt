KiCad PCB Design â€“ Evaluation Task

This repository contains the PCB design created as part of the evaluation task using **KiCad**.


## ðŸ“Œ Task Overview
1. **PCB Creation**
   - Added components:
     - Default KiCad LED symbol with footprint and 3D model is downloaded and modified.
     - Custom symbol + footprint for **TCAN4551-Q1** (VQFN-20 package) and 3D model is download.
     - Default KiCad symbol **MCIMX6D4AVT**.
     - Verified footprints with 3D viewer and picture attached.

2. **Custom Libraries**
   - Created a **custom symbol library** (`tcan4551-q1.kicad_sym`).
   - Created a **custom footprint library** (`TCAN4551_VQFN20.kicad_mod`).
   - Linked symbol and footprint.
   - 3D model is download.

3. **Design Rules**
   - Applied custom microvia design rules:
     - Minimum annular width: **2 mil**
     - Minimum via diameter: **8 mil**
     - Minimum via hole: **4 mil**

4. **Bonus**
   - Library for **TCAN4551-Q1** also stored in a separate repository, which can be mounted as a submodule.
